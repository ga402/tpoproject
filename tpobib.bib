  abstract = {Our understanding of thrombopoiesis — the formation of blood platelets — has improved greatly in the last decade, with the cloning and characterization of thrombopoietin, the primary regulator of this process. Thrombopoietin affects nearly all aspects of platelet production, from self-renewal and expansion of HSCs, through stimulation of the proliferation of megakaryocyte progenitor cells, to support of the maturation of these cells into platelet-producing cells. The molecular and cellular mechanisms through which thrombopoietin affects platelet production provide new insights into the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic influences on hematopoiesis and highlight new opportunities to translate basic biology into clinical advances.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the behaviour of endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) serum levels during rapid sequences of dose-intensified chemotherapy. To characterize the relationship between TPO levels and platelet counts in this setting we serially measured both parameters over the entire treatment period of patients receiving multicycle polychemotherapy. We found TPO and platelet responses to be generally antagonistic through all cycles. However, a cross-correlation analysis indicated that TPO responses preceded platelet responses by approximately one day in all patients. The cumulative severity of thrombocytopenia observed over successive cycles was accompanied by an increasing TPO response which tended to grow overproportionally in relation to the degree of peripheral thrombocytopenia. These findings are consistent with a model suggesting that both platelet and megakaryocyte mass contribute to a receptor-dependent consumption process regulating the endogenous TPO level. In order to develop optimal schedules for exogenous TPO administration it might be important to consider endogenous TPO response characteristics.},

  abstract = {Background:
Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the key hematopoietic growth factor regulating the production of platelets from bone marrow megakaryocytes and maintaining platelet hemostasis. This study was done to find any relationship between the levels of thrombopoietin and the severity of disease in patients with aplastic anemia.

Materials and Methods:
Serum samples were collected from 52 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of aplastic anemia and 45 normal healthy blood donors of both sexes over a period of 2 years, and TPO was estimated by using commercially available TPO-specific-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results:
The median TPO level of 1190 pg/ml (range 625-7651 pg/ml) in aplastic anemia patients was significantly higher than the median TPO level of 121.1 pg/ml (81.25-237.7 pg/ml) in normal healthy blood donors (P = 0.000). No significant difference was observed in TPO levels of male and female patients (P = 0.453). The median TPO concentrations observed in very severe aplastic anemia, severe aplastic anemia, and nonsevere aplastic anemia were 2765 pg/ml (range 625-6451 pg/ml), 1190 pg/ml (range 672.1-7651 pg/ml), and 1111.5 pg/ml (range 761.1-2289.2 pg/ml), respectively. TPO in patients of very severe aplastic anemia was significantly higher than patients of nonsevere aplastic anemia (P = 0.043), with no significant relation among rest of the groups.

Discussion:
TPO levels in aplastic anemia patients were significantly higher than in healthy blood donors; however, in aplastic anemia patients TPO levels were significantly higher only in patients with very severe disease.},

  abstract = {Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by increased platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in primary ITP patients. Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included in this study, the pooled results of which demonstrated that TPO-RAs significantly increased platelet response (R) and durable response (DR) rates [risk ratio (RR): 2.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.01–3.82, P = 5.9 × 10−10; RR: 7.52, 95\% CI: 3.94–14.35, P = 9.2 × 10−10; respectively] and that TPO-RAs significantly reduced the incidences of any or severe bleeding events (RR: 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.67–0.95, P = 0.013; RR: 0.52, 95\% CI: 0.27–0.99, P = 0.048; respectively). Moreover, our results indicated that there was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients needing rescue medications in the TPO-RA groups compared with the control groups (RR: 0.50, 95\% CI: 0.42–0.59, P = 2.0 × 10−15) and that the rates of any or severe adverse events were similar between the TPO-RA and control regimens (RR: 1.01, 95\% CI: 0.92–1.10; RR: 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.54–1.01; respectively). These findings demonstrate that TPO-RAs are an effective and safe second-line treatment option for primary ITP patients.},

  abstract = {Thrombocytopenia is defined as a status in which platelet numbers are reduced. Imbalance between the homeostatic regulation of platelet generation and destruction is 1 potential cause of thrombocytopenia. In adults, platelet generation is a 2-stage process entailing the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into mature megakaryocytes (MKs; known as megakaryopoiesis) and release of platelets from MKs (known as thrombopoiesis or platelet biogenesis). Until recently, information about the genetic defects responsible for congenital thrombocytopenia was only available for a few forms of the disease. However, investigations over the past 15 years have identified mutations in genes encoding $>$20 different proteins that are responsible for these disorders, which has advanced our understanding of megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms can be categorized as (1) defects in MK lineage commitment and differentiation, (2) defects in MK maturation, and (3) defect in platelet release. Using these developmental stage categories, we here update recently described mechanisms underlying megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis and discuss the association between platelet generation systems and thrombocytopenia.},
