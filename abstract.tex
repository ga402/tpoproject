\paragraph{Introduction:} Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a haematopoietic growth factor, prodominately produced by the liver and kidneys, whose major function is in the regulation of platelet production. The exact mechanisms that regulate TPO levels are highly debated. The predominant hypothesis is that TPO is synthesised in a constitutive manner and its concentration in the blood is determined by the total volume of platelets. This is achieved by TPO binding to high-affinity receptors on the surface of platelets which then remove it from the circulation (the `sponge theory'). % As platelet counts fall, TPO levels rise, and vice-versa. %\cite{EtoLinkagemechanismsthrombocytopenia2016}. %% could try and compress this a bit  %
In patients with active ITP, TPO levels have been shown to have inappropriately low. It is believed this is because in active ITP there is a higher rate of platelet turnover which causes additional TPO to be consumed. What has not been well described is how TPO levels change as platelet counts increase and patients enter an episode of remission (platelet count \geqslant100-150$x10^9/L$). To better understand the relationship between TPO and platelets in ITP we measured TPO levels in a 67 patients with chronic ITP and 5 patients with aplastic anaemia with a range of different platelet counts. We used aplastic anaemia as a comparator as these patients are thrombocytopenic but lack a direct immune-mediated platelet destruction. We used a bayesian regresssion model to analyse the association between TPO and platelet counts. This approach allows us to infer the probability distribution of TPO over a range of different platelet counts and has been shown to be more accurate with smaller sample sizes than classical gaussian regression models. % \cite{GoldsteinBayesiananalysisregression1976}.


\paragraph{Methods:} Blood samples were collected in duplicate in sodium citrate vacutainer tubes. Samples were double spun and stored at -80Â°C within four hours of collection. Each patient had a full blood count at the time of testing. TPO levels were measured using quantitive sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique according to the manufacturers instructions. Optical density values were measured by microplate reader. We used log-normalised tpo and platelet counts in a bayesian regression model; $log(TPO) = alpha + beta*log(platelet)$. Our priors for the model where uninformative gaussian distributions (mean 0.01, standard deviation 10). We used gibbs sampling with 100,000 iterations to calculate posterior distributions from which we derived \textit{maximium a posteriori} (MAP) estimates and 90\% Bayesian Confidence intervals (BCI) for a range of platelet counts (1 to 200$x10^9/L$).


\paragraph{Results:} Of the 130 samples collected, 30 samples were excluded for failing to detect any TPO. All but 1 of these patient had a second positive repeat sample. In the ITP group, the median TPO level was 43pg/ml (range 1.7-923.4pg/ml) with a median platelet count of 63$x10^9/L$ (range 3 - 328$x10^9/L$). For our Aplastic anaemia group we had 9 samples with a median TPO of 1887.6pg/ml (range 9.4-4572.5pg/ml) with a median platelet count of 20$x10^9/L$ (range 4 to 102$x10^9/L$). The higher platelet counts (\geqslant35$x10^9/L$) in this aplastic group were from patients on tacrolimus therapy (n= 3). There was a clear non-linear relationship between platelet counts and TPO levels in both ITP and aplastic patients (FIGURE 1). At any given platelet count, MAP TPO estimates in our ITP cohort were approximately a tenth of our aplastic group.  At a platelet count of 1 the MAP TPO estimate in ITP was 410pg/ml (BCI; 200-804pg/ml). This declined sharply to 100pg/ml as the platelet count increased to 10$x10^9/L$. The decline in TPO became increasingly shallow as platelet counts increased, such that at a platelet count of 50$x10^9/L$, the MAP estimate for TPO was 37.5pg.ml (BCI 31 to 46pg/ml) and at 200$x10^9/L$ it was 16pg/ml (BCI 11-21 pg/ml). 13\% of our ITP patients were on TPOagonists, although a sensitivity analysis found this did not significantly influence model estimates. In comparison the MAP estimates for TPO in our Aplastic group were \geqslant10000pg/ml at a platelet count of 1$x10^9/L$, 572pg/ml at a platelet count of 50$x10^9/L$, and 221pg/ml (BIC 112 to 828pg/ml) at a platelet count of 100$x10^9/L$. This is approaching the normal range for a healthy individual (mean 120pg/ml, range 80 - 230pg/ml).

\paragraph{Conclusions:} Our study showed that in patients with ITP and aplastic anaemia there is a non-linear correlation between platelet count and TPO levels, with a rapid fall in TPO between platelet counts 1-10$x10^9/L$ then a much slower decline thereafter. The levels of TPO in our ITP patients were consistently lower than in our aplastic thrombocytopenic controls at all platelet counts. This indicates that even at higher platelet counts, ITP remains at least partially active in patients with chronic disease. This suggests that TPO, when used in this model, may have a diagnostic utility or be a possible biomarker for immune-mediated platelet destruction (ITP). The fact that this model distinguishes ITP from non-ITP even at normal platelet counts is of particular interest. There is a need for such a marker in early-stage ITP to differentiate between patients who will develop chronic ITP from those who will enter a life-long remission, or from those who actually have a bone marrow disorder. As such, our group is currently undertaking a further validation study to investigate the diagnostic utility of this model.
